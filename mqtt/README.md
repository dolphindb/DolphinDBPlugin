## 1. Load Precompiled Plugin

There are two options to load the MQTT client plugin in DolphinDB:

* Using the function `loadPlugin`
* Specifying the configuration parameter *preloadModules*

### 1.1 Function `loadPlugin` 

```
loadPlugin("/YOUR_PATH/mqtt/PluginMQTTClient.txt"); 
```

Note: You can modify the path as appropriate. With a Windows OS, make sure to specify an absolute path and replace "\\" with "\\\\" or "/".

### 1.2 Configuration Parameter *preloadModules*

Alternatively, you can preload the plugin during server startup by specifying the configuration parameter *preloadModules*, so you don't have to call `loadPlugin` afterwards. For single-machine deployment, configure the parameter in *dolphindb.cfg*. For cluster deployment, the plugin must be loaded on both the controller and the associated data node(s), and the simplest way is to configure the parameter in both *controller.cfg* and *cluster.cfg*.

```
preloadModules=plugins::mqtt,plugins::odbc
```

Separate plugins with a comma.

Note:

* The configuration parameter *preloadModules* is only supported on server version 1.20.x and higher.
* *preloadModules* is used to preload plugins and modules in DolphinDB. The directory for the plugin files are specified by the configuration parameter *pluginDir*. For more information, see [documentation](https://dolphindb.com/help200/DatabaseandDistributedComputing/Configuration/StandaloneMode.html).

## 2. (Optional) Manually Compile Plugin
### 2.1 Linux

* This plugin has been successfully compiled with GCC (version 5.4.0) on 64-bits Linux operating system.
* Before compiling, install [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

For Ubuntu users, just type

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install git cmake
```
* Create a 'build' directory. Under the directory, run `cmake ..` and `make` to generate 'libPluginMQTTClient.so'.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### 2.2 Windows
This plugin has been successfully compiled with MinGW-W64-builds-4.3.3 on 64-bits Windows operating system. Install [cmake](https://cmake.org/) and [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) on your machine. Add the "bin" directories of MinGW and cmake to your PATH on Windows.

```
    git clone https://github.com/dolphindb/DolphinDBPlugin.git
    cd DolphinDBPlugin/mqtt
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    copy /YOURPATH/libDolphinDB.dll . 
    make
```

**Note:** To specify a different path for MinGW, modify the following line in *CmakeList.txt*:

```
    set(MINGW32_LOCATION C://MinGW/MinGW/)  
```

The *libPluginMQTTClient.dll* file is generated after compilation. Next, refer to the procedure described in Section 1 "Load Precompiled Plugin" to load the compiled plugin. 

## 3. Publish

### 3.1 Connect to a MQTT server/broker

**Syntax**

```
mqtt::connect(host, port,[QoS=0],[formatter],[batchSize=0],[username],[password])
```
The function connect to a MQTT server/broker. It returns a connection object which can be explicitly called to close with the `close` function, or it can be automatically released when the reference count is 0.

**Arguments**

- 'host' is a string indicating the IP address of MQTT server/broker.

- 'port' is an integer indicating the port number of MQTT server/broker.

- 'Qos' is an integer indicating the quality of service. 0: at most once; 1: at least once; 2: only once. It is optional and the default value is 0.

- 'formatter' is a function used to package published data in a format. Currently supported functions are ``createJsonFormatter`` and ``createCsvFormatter``.

- 'batchSize' is an integer. When the content to be published is a table, it can be sent in batches, and *batchSize* indicates the number of rows sent each time.

- 'username' and 'password' are user credentials to the MQTT server/broker.

**Example**
```
f=mqtt::createJsonFormatter()
conn=connect("test.mosquitto.org",1883,0,f,50)
```

### 3.2 Publish

**Syntax**

```
mqtt::publish(conn,topic,obj)
```

This function posts one or more messages to the MQTT server/broker

**Arguments**

- 'conn' is an object generated by function

- 'topic' is a string indicating the subscription topic.

- 'obj' is the content of the message to be published, which can be a table or a string or an array of strings.


**Example**

```
mqtt::publish(conn,"dolphindb/topic1","welcome")
mqtt::publish(conn,"devStr/sensor001",["hello world","welcome"])
t=table(take(0..99,50) as hardwareId ,take(now(),
		50) as ts,rand(20..41,50) as temperature,
		rand(50,50) as humidity,rand(500..1000,
		50) as voltage)
mqtt::publish(conn,"dolphindb/device",t)		

``` 

### 3.3 Close the connection

**Syntax**

```
mqtt::close(conn)
```

This function disconnects from the server/broker.

**Arguments**

- 'conn' is an object generated by function.

**Example**
```
mqtt::close(conn)
```

## 4. Subscribe/Unsubscribe

### 4.1 Subscribe

**Syntax**

```
mqtt::subscribe(host, port, topic, [parser], handler,[username],[password])
```

**Arguments**

- 'host' is a string indicating the IP address of MQTT server/broker.

- 'port' is an integer indicating the port number of MQTT server/broker.

- 'topic' is a string indicating the subscription topic.

- 'parser' is a function for parsing subscribed messages. Currently supported functions are createJsonParser and createCsvParser

- 'handler' is a function or a table to process the subscribed data.

- 'username' and 'password' are strings indicating user credentials to the MQTT server/broker.

**Details**

Subscribe to a MQTT server/broker. It returns a connection object.

**Example**

```
p = createCsvParser([INT, TIMESTAMP, DOUBLE, DOUBLE,DOUBLE], ',', ';' )
sensorInfoTable = table( 10000:0,`deviceID`send_time`temperature`humidity`voltage,[INT, TIMESTAMP, DOUBLE, DOUBLE,DOUBLE])
conn = mqtt::subscribe("192.168.1.201",1883,"sensor/#",p,sensorInfoTable)
```

### 4.2 Check Subscription

```
mqtt::getSubscriberStat()    
```
Get the information on all subscriptions. Return a table with the following columns:

- "subscriptionId" - ID of a subscription
- "user" - the session user who created the subscription
- "host" - IP address for the MQTT server/broker
- "port" - Port number of the MQTT server/broker
- "topic" - the subscription topic
- "createTimestamp" - the time when the subscription was created
- "receivedPackets" - the number of messages received

### 4.3 Unsubscribe

**Syntax**

```
mqtt::unsubcribe(subscription)  
```
Cancel subscription to the MQTT server/broker.

**Arguments**

- 'subscription' is the value returned by the `subscribe` function or the subscription ID returned by `getSubscriberStat`.

**Example**
