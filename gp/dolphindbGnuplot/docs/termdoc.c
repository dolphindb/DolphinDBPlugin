/* this file provides a replacement for fgets() which inserts all the
 * help from the terminal drivers line by line at the < in the
 * gnuplot.doc file. This way, doc2* dont need to know what's going
 * on, and think it's all coming from one place.
 *
 * Can be compiled as a standalone program to generate the raw
 * .doc test, when compiled with -DTEST_TERMDOC
 *
 * Strips comment lines {so none of doc2* need to bother}
 * but magic comments beginning  C#  are used as markers
 * for line number recording (as c compilers)
 * We set BEGIN_HELP macro to "C#<driver>" as a special marker.
 *
 * Hmm - this is turning more and more into a preprocessor !
 * gnuplot.doc now has multiple top-level entries, but
 * some help systems (eg VMS) cannot tolerate this.
 * As a complete bodge, conditional on TBOOLEAN single_top_level == TRUE,
 * we accept only the first 1, and map any subsequent 1's to 2's
 * At present, this leaves a bogus, empty section called
 * commands, but that's a small price to pay to get it
 * working properly
