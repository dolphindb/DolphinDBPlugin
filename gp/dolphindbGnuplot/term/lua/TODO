TODO and known issues
=====================

Lua generic terminal

 * support color palettes (low priority, not really needed for TikZ?)
 * support enhanced text mode (low priority, not really needed for TikZ)
 * sort out what needs to be built + included as part of preparing a
   distribution package

TikZ backend

 * automatic detection of font sizes (via LaTeX test call?! very low
   priority. It works with the gnuplottex package and the charsize option,
   see style file for an example)

 * setting the background color within a gnuplot (gnuplottex) environment
   does not work if the tikzpicture environment is used of this scope:
     \begin{tikzpicture}[gnuplot]
       \begin{gnuplot}[...]
       \end{gnuplot}
     \end{tikzpicture}
   As a workaround the background color can also be set manually right after
   \begin{tikzpicture}[gnuplot] using the \gpsetbgcolor{R,G,B} command.

 * there is an incompatibility/bug of the preview package and TikZ that leads
   to erroneous files on dvi and postscript output using the terminal's
   standalone mode. PDF output works flawlessly.

 * pattern fills are not supported by XeTeX
