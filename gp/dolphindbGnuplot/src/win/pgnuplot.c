/*
 * pgnuplot.c -- 'Pipe to gnuplot'  Version 990608
 *
 * A small program, to be compiled as a Win32 console mode application.
 * (NB: will not work on 16bit Windows, not even with Win32s installed).
 *
 * This program will accept commands on STDIN, and pipe them to an
 * active (or newly created) wgnuplot text window. Command line options
 * are passed on to wgnuplot.
 *
 * Effectively, this means `pgnuplot' is an almost complete substitute
 * for `wgnuplot', on the command line, with the added benefit that it
 * does accept commands from redirected stdin. (Being a Windows GUI
 * application, `wgnuplot' itself cannot read stdin at all.)
 *
 * Copyright (C) 1999 by Hans-Bernhard Broeker
 *                       (broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de)
 * This file is in the public domain. It might become part of a future
 * distribution of gnuplot.
 *
 * based on a program posted to comp.graphics.apps.gnuplot in May 1998 by
 * jl Hamel <jlhamel@cea.fr>
 *
 * Changes relative to that original version:
 * -- doesn't start a new wgnuplot if one already is running.
 * -- doesn't end up in an endless loop if STDIN is not redirected.
 *    (refuses to read from STDIN at all, in that case).
 * -- doesn't stop the wgnuplot session at the end of
 *    stdin, if it didn't start wgnuplot itself.
 * -- avoids the usual buffer overrun problem with gets().
 *
 * For the record, I usually use MinGW32 to compile this, with a
 * command line looking like this:
 *
 *     gcc -o pgnuplot.exe pgnuplot.c -luser32 -s
 *
 * Note that if you're using Cygwin GCC, you'll want to add the option
 * -mno-cygwin to that command line to avoid getting a pgnuplot.exe
 * that depends on their GPL'ed cygwin1.dll.

/*	Modifications by Craig R. Schardt (17 Jun 1999)

	Copyright (C) 1999 by Craig R. Schardt (craig@silica.mse.ufl.edu)

	Major changes: (See the explanation below for more information)
		+ Always starts a new instance of wgnuplot.
		+ If stdin isn't redirected then start wgnuplot and give it focus.
		+ Uses CreateProcess() instead of WinExec() to start wgnuplot when stdin
		  is redirected.

	Other changes:
		+ New technique for building the command line to pass to wgnuplot.exe
		  which is less complicated and seems to work more reliably than the old
		  technique.
		+ Simplified message passing section of the code.
		+ All printf(...) statements are now fprintf(stderr,...) so that errors
		  are sent to the console, even if stdout is redirected.

	The previous version of pgnuplot would fail when more than one program
	tried to access wgnuplot simultaneously or when one program tried to start
	more than one wgnuplot session. Only a single instance of wgnuplot would be
	started and all input would be sent to that instance. When two or more programs
	tried to pipe input to wgnuplot, the two separate input streams would be sent
	to one wgnuplot window resulting in one very confused copy of wgnuplot. The only
	way to avoid this problem was to change pgnuplot so that it would start a
	new instance of wgnuplot every time.

	Just starting a new instance of wgnuplot isn't enough. pgnuplot must also
	make sure that the data on each stdin pipe is sent to the proper wgnuplot
	instance. This is achieved by using CreateProcess() which returns a handle
	to the newly created process. Once the process has initialized, it can be
	searched for the text window and then data can be routed correctly. The search
	is carried out by the EnumThreadWindows() call and the data passing is carried
	out by a rewritten version of the original code. With these changes, pgnuplot
	now behaves in a manner consistent with the behavior of gnuplot on UNIX
	computers.

	This program has been compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 with the
	following command line:

		cl /O2 pgnuplot.c /link user32.lib

	The resulting program has been tested on WinNT and Win98 both by calling
	it directly from the command line with and without redirected input. The
	program also works on WinNT with a modified version of Gnuplot.py (a script
	for interactive control of Gnuplot from Python).

	22 JUN 1999:
	+ Fixed command line code to behave properly when the first
	  item is quoted in the original command line.

	29 JUN 1999:
	+ Added some code to print the command line. This is for testing
	  only and should be removed before the general release. To enable,
	  compile with SHOWCMDLINE defined.

	30 JUN 1999:
	+ New function FindUnquotedSpace() which replaces the earlier technique for
	  finding the command line arguments to send on to wgnuplot. Prior to this
	  the arguments were assumed to start after argv[0], however argv[0] is not
	  set the same by all combinations of compiler, command processor, and OS.
	  The new method ignores argv completely and manually search the command line
	  string for the first space which isn't enclosed in double-quotes.
