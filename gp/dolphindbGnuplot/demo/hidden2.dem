# PM3D surfaces are not fully included in the calculation of hidden line removal.
# Older versions of gnuplot allowed you to approximate the correct occlusion
# by drawing the surface twice, once "with pm3d" to produce the surface you
# want to show, and once "with lines lt -2" to include the same surface in
# hidden3d calculations but drawn with invisible lines.
# Current gnuplot does the approximation for you so the extra copy of the 
# surface is no longer necessary.
