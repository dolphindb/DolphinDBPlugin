// / \section synopsis Synopsis
// / This library provides a wrapper API for the native ODBC API. It aims to do everything ODBC does,
// / but with a \b much nicer interface. Anything it doesn't (yet) do can be done by retrieving the
// / native ODBC handles and dropping down to straight ODBC C API code.
// / For more propaganda, please see the <a href="http://nanodbc.io/">project
// / homepage</a>.
