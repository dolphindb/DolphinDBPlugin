# DolphinDB formatArrow Plugin

Apache Arrow defines a columnar memory format, which combines the benefits of columnar data structures with in-memory computing. With the DolphinDB formatArrow plugin, you can use the Arrow format to interact with the DolphinDB server through Python API with automatic data type conversion.

The version of Apache Arrow used in this document is *9.0.0*.

The DolphinDB zip plugin has different branches, such as release200. Each branch corresponds to a DolphinDB server version. Please make sure you are in the correct branch of the plugin documentation.

## 1. Install Plugin

### 1.1 (Optional) Manually Compile Plugin - Linux

#### Configure the Environment

a. Compile the plugin development kit

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/arrow.git
cd arrow/cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. 
make -j
```

b. After compilation, save the following files to your DolphinDB plugin directory:

| **File**                                | **Target Directory** |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| arrow/cpp/src/arrow                     | ./include            |
| arrow/cpp/build/release/libarrow.so.900 | ./build              |

#### Compile Plugin

Before compilation, make sure the directories of *libDolphinDB.so* (included in the server package) and *libarrow.so.900* have been added to the GCC search path. You can set *LD_LIBRARY_PATH* or directly save the files under the *build* directory.

```
cd /path/to/plugins/formatArrow
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### 1.2 Load Plugin

Alternatively, you can skip the manual compilation steps and simply download the precompile files *libarrow.so.900*, *libPluginFormatArrow.so* and *PluginFormatArrow.txt* at DolphinDBPlugin/formatArrow. Save the files under your DolphinDB plugin directory. 

To load the plugin, enter the following command in DolphinDB:

```
loadFormatPlugin("/path/to/plugin/PluginFormatArrow.txt")
```

## 2. Usage Example

a. Enter the following command on the DolphinDB server side to load the plugin:

```
loadFormatPlugin("path/to/formatArrow/PluginFormatArrow.txt")
```

b. On the Python API side, execute the following script:

```
import dolphindb as ddb
import dolphindb.settings as keys
s = ddb.session("192.168.1.113", 8848, "admin", "123456", protocol=keys.PROTOCOL_ARROW)
pat = s.run("table(1..10 as a)")

print(pat)
-------------------------------------------
pyarrow.Table
a: int32
----
a: [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]]
```

Note: Currently, the DolphinDB server doesnâ€™t support enabling compression when the Arrow protocol is used.

## 3. Supported Data Types

### DolphinDB to Arrow 

When DolphinDB transfers data to the Python application through Python API, the data type mappings between DolphinDB and Arrow are as follows:

| DolphinDB     | Arrow                   |
| :------------ | :---------------------- |
| BOOL          | boolean                 |
| CHAR          | int8                    |
| SHORT         | int16                   |
| INT           | int32                   |
| LONG          | int64                   |
| DATE          | date32                  |
| MONTH         | date32                  |
| TIME          | time32(ms)              |
| MINUTE        | time32(s)               |
| SECOND        | time32(s)               |
| DATETIME      | timestamp(s)            |
| TIMESTAMP     | timestamp(ms)           |
| NANOTIME      | time64(ns)              |
| NANOTIMESTAMP | timestamp(ns)           |
| DATEHOUR      | timestamp(s)            |
| FLOAT         | float32                 |
| DOUBLE        | float64                 |
| SYMBOL        | dictionary(int32, utf8) |
| STRING        | utf8                    |
| IPADDR        | utf8                    |
| UUID          | fixed_size_binary(16)   |
| INT128        | fixed_size_binary(16)   |
| BLOB          | large_binary            |
| DECIMAL32(X)  | decimal128(38, X)       |
| DECIMAL64(X)  | decimal128(38, X)       |

Array vectors of the types listed above (excluding the Decimal types) are also supported.

Note: When converting Arrow-formatted data sent from the DolphinDB server to a pandas.DataFrame, the DolphinDB *NANOTIME*  type is converted to Arrow *time64* type. The NANOTIME value must be a multiple of 1,000, otherwise the error `Value xxxxxxx has non-zero nanoseconds` is raised.
